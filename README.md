# NextDoorFarm

**Goal**

The purpose of the application is to make eco-products available to wide range of people. It connects farmers with end-users. The application may ease the process of distributing the goods from local farms. This project is useful for the end-users as well as to the agriculturists. Above all, we hope to provide a comfortable user experience along with the best pricing available.

The application allows users to:

- Search for fresh products
- Subscribe to a product delivery
- Add products to account (available for farmers)
- Chat between customers and sellers
- Rate a seller
- Safely pay online
- Track order location
